title: Welcome to the Rizom Collective
---

This is the shared knowledge space of the Rizom collective. Here we organize our ideas, coordinate projects, and build together.

Everything in this brain is markdown — portable, readable, and version-controlled. Notes are the building blocks. From notes, we generate blog posts, social media content, presentations, and our website.

Start by exploring what's here, or create a new note to capture your thoughts.
