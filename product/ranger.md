## Story

Ranger is the collective brain — an orchestration layer for organizations that want to think and communicate as one.

A collective is more than a team. It has a public identity, a shared mission, and many voices that need to speak coherently. Ranger gives the collective a brain of its own — one that coordinates knowledge across members, generates a unified public presence, and keeps everyone moving in the same direction.

Each member can run their own brain. Ranger connects them. Knowledge flows between individual brains and the collective, with each level maintaining its own identity. The individual doesn't lose their voice — the collective amplifies it.

Built for groups who think together.
