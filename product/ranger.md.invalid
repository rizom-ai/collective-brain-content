## Story

An organization is more than a team with a shared folder. A community is more than a group chat. Both have a public identity, a shared mission, and many voices that need to speak coherently without being flattened into one. Most collaboration tools either force consensus or fragment into chaos. Ranger is built for the space in between.

Ranger gives the group a brain of its own. One that coordinates knowledge across members, generates a unified public presence, and keeps everyone aligned without centralizing control. The website, social channels, and public communications all draw from the same source of truth, updated by anyone with permission.

Each member keeps their own brain. Ranger connects them. Knowledge flows between individual brains and the shared brain, with each level maintaining its own identity. A researcher's insights can surface in the organization's blog. The community's mission statement can inform a member's slide deck. The individual doesn't lose their voice. The group amplifies it.

Built for groups who think together.
