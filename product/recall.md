Recall is the team brain — a shared memory for groups who need to stay aligned without drowning in tools.

Teams lose knowledge every day. Decisions made in chat vanish. Meeting notes rot in shared drives. Onboarding means asking the same questions again and again. Recall fixes this by giving the team a single, searchable brain that everyone contributes to and draws from.

Write it once, find it always. Recall captures notes, decisions, and context in plain markdown. It understands your team's vocabulary and connects related ideas automatically. When someone asks "what did we decide about X?", Recall has the answer.

Built for teams who think out loud.
