## Story

Teams lose knowledge every day. Decisions made in chat vanish into scroll history. Meeting notes rot in shared drives nobody opens. Onboarding means asking the same questions again and again, hoping someone remembers the answer. The problem isn't that teams don't document — it's that documentation never keeps up with the speed of work.

Recall fixes this by giving the team a single, searchable brain that everyone contributes to and draws from. Write it once, find it always. Notes, decisions, and context live in plain markdown that Recall indexes and connects automatically. When someone asks "what did we decide about X?" — the answer is already there.

The best part: Recall captures knowledge from the work itself. Chat threads surface decisions. Meeting transcripts become structured notes. The team's memory grows as a byproduct of doing the work, not as a separate chore that everyone avoids.

Built for teams who think out loud.
