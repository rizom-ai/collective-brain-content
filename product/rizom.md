Rizom is the collective brain — a shared knowledge coordinator for organizations and teams.

Where Rover helps individuals manage their personal knowledge, Rizom brings people together. It provides a shared space where a collective can define its identity, coordinate projects, and publish a unified presence — all powered by the same AI-native architecture.

Every piece of knowledge in Rizom is markdown. Every feature is a plugin. The collective decides which capabilities to enable, and the brain adapts. Need a website? Add the site-builder plugin. Need social media presence? Add the social plugin. The architecture grows with the collective.

Built for groups who think together.
