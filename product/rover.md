## Story

Most knowledge tools make you choose: capture or create. Note apps are great at storing thoughts but terrible at doing anything with them. Publishing tools are great at output but start from a blank page every time. Rover refuses to split the difference.

It turns scattered notes, ideas, and drafts into polished content. Write a thought, and Rover can shape it into a blog post, a social update, or a slide deck. Everything stays in plain text, portable and yours. Nothing is locked in a proprietary format, nothing lives on someone else's server.

Rover learns your voice. The more you write, the better it understands how you think and communicate. It doesn't replace your creativity. It amplifies it by handling the mechanical parts of content creation so you can focus on what actually matters: the ideas themselves.

Built for people who think by writing.
