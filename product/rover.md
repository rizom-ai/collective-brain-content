## Story

Rover is the professional brain — a personal knowledge operating system for creators, writers, and independent professionals.

It turns scattered notes, ideas, and drafts into polished content. Write a thought, and Rover can shape it into a blog post, a social media update, or a slide deck. Everything stays in markdown, portable and yours.

Rover learns your voice. The more you write, the better it understands how you think and communicate. It doesn't replace your creativity — it amplifies it by handling the mechanical parts of content creation so you can focus on the ideas.

Built for people who think by writing.
