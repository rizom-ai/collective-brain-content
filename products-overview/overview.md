# Products Overview

## Vision

We believe knowledge work deserves better tools. Not more tools — better ones.

Most platforms lock your thinking into someone else's structure. Your notes live in proprietary formats, your content is scattered across disconnected apps, and your workflow adapts to the tool instead of the other way around. The Brains platform changes this: AI-native models that adapt to how you think and work — whether you're an individual creator, a fast-moving team, or a coordinated collective.

## Core Principles

### Pillar 1

#### Title

AI-Native

#### Description

Built from the ground up with AI at the core, not bolted on as an afterthought. Your brain learns your voice, understands your domain, and actively helps you create — from drafting blog posts to summarizing meetings.

### Pillar 2

#### Title

Plugin-Based

#### Description

Every capability is a plugin — add what you need, skip what you don't. Blogging, chat, social publishing, slide decks: compose your brain from building blocks that work together.

### Pillar 3

#### Title

Markdown-First

#### Description

All content stored as portable, human-readable markdown files. No database lock-in, no proprietary formats. Your data is plain text on disk — readable, versionable, and yours to move anywhere.

## How It Works

### Step 1

#### Title

Pick Your Brain

#### Description

Choose a brain model matched to your context — personal knowledge management, team collaboration, or collective coordination. Each one comes pre-configured for its use case, ready to go out of the box.

### Step 2

#### Title

Add What You Need

#### Description

Every brain is built from plugins. Blogging, chat, social publishing, slide decks — compose exactly the capabilities you want. Remove what you don't need. Your brain, your rules.

### Step 3

#### Title

Own Everything

#### Description

All your content lives as plain markdown files. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats. Export, migrate, or read your data directly — it's always yours.

AI That Learns You

Your brain adapts to your voice and style the more you use it. It doesn't replace your thinking — it amplifies it by handling the mechanical parts so you can focus on ideas.
