# Products Overview

## Vision

We believe knowledge work deserves better tools. Not more tools — better ones.

Most platforms lock your thinking into someone else's structure. Your notes live in proprietary formats, your content is scattered across disconnected apps, and your workflow adapts to the tool instead of the other way around. The Brains platform changes this: AI-native models that adapt to how you think and work — whether you're an individual creator, a fast-moving team, or a coordinated collective.

## Core Principles

### Pillar 1

#### Title

AI-Native

#### Description

Built from the ground up with AI at the core, not bolted on as an afterthought. Your brain learns your voice, understands your domain, and actively helps you create — from drafting blog posts to summarizing meetings.

### Pillar 2

#### Title

Plugin-Based

#### Description

Every capability is a plugin — add what you need, skip what you don't. Blogging, chat, social publishing, slide decks: compose your brain from building blocks that work together.

### Pillar 3

#### Title

Markdown-First

#### Description

All content stored as portable, human-readable markdown files. No database lock-in, no proprietary formats. Your data is plain text on disk — readable, versionable, and yours to move anywhere.

## How It Works

### Step 1

#### Title

Capture

#### Description

Write notes, save links, log meeting decisions — everything goes into your brain as plain markdown. No special syntax, no learning curve. If you can write a sentence, you can feed your brain.

### Step 2

#### Title

Connect

#### Description

Your brain links related ideas automatically. It understands context, surfaces forgotten notes when they're relevant, and builds a knowledge graph that grows smarter the more you use it.

### Step 3

#### Title

Create

#### Description

Turn captured knowledge into published content. A note becomes a blog post. Meeting notes become action items. Research becomes a slide deck. Your brain handles the transformation — you keep the credit.

## Brain Models

Three brain models, each built for a different scale of thinking — from solo creators to coordinated collectives.

## Built With

### Technology 1

#### Title

Markdown Storage

#### Description

All content lives as plain text files on disk. No proprietary database, no binary formats. Your data is readable, versionable, and portable — move it anywhere, read it with any editor.

### Technology 2

#### Title

Plugin Architecture

#### Description

Every feature is a composable building block. Add blogging, chat, social publishing, or slide decks independently. Build custom plugins to extend your brain with any capability you need.

### Technology 3

#### Title

Open Messaging

#### Description

Communicate through any messaging platform you already use. Your brain interfaces with existing tools rather than replacing them — keeping conversations where your team already works.

## Why Brains

### Benefit 1

#### Title

Write Once, Use Everywhere

#### Description

A single idea can become a blog post, a social update, a slide deck, or a team brief. Your brain adapts your content to any format without starting from scratch.

### Benefit 2

#### Title

Zero Lock-In

#### Description

Every piece of content is a markdown file you can read, move, or delete. No proprietary formats, no export wizards, no hostage negotiations. Leave anytime and take everything with you.

### Benefit 3

#### Title

Grows With You

#### Description

Start with a personal brain. Add team members and it becomes a shared memory. Connect multiple brains and you have a collective. The platform scales from solo to organization without switching tools.
